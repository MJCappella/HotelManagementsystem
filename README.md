# HotelManagementsystem
<p>This is a hotel management system that was done in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the ALX software Engineering programme in the foundations level. It is a system built to ease the room booking process for customers intending to have a stay in any hotel lounge.</p>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>This is a system that easens the booking process for customers who wish to book hotel rooms in a stay. A user registers for an account in the system and logs in using the same account. Once validated, they are redirected to trhe landing page / homepage where they are able to view some buttons and their functions. From the buttons in the nav bar they can choose to make a bookin, contact the administrators or log out of their accounts.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>MVC Architecture Pattern : Model: Represents the data layer, managing database interactions and business logic. View: Handles the presentation layer, displaying data to users and collecting user inputs. Controller: Manages the flow between the Model and the View, processing user requests, updating models, and rendering the appropriate views.</p>
<p>Backend Structure : Flask routes and controllers handle HTTP requests and responses. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions, providing an abstraction layer for data manipulation.</p>
<p>Security Measures : User authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data and secure transactions.</p>
